                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Geoff Metzger, and I'm a recent graduate of
                    Governors State University, where I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I don't have any professional work experience yet, I have spent the last few years
                    honing my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science. Throughout my studies, I have developed a passion for Web develpment, and I'm excited to put my expertise to use in
                    the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from my academic pursuits, I've also had the opportunity to work on a variety of personal
                    projects that have allowed me to apply what I've learned and gain hands-on experience.
